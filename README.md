# Optimisation of the waiting time in a restaurant

## Introduction

As part of the ARE Dynamic course at Sorbonne University we had to choose a Dynamic system to model in the semester’s time frame. It is a mean to use Mathematical and Computer programming notions on a specific subject.

After a few weeks of an introduction course on python we had to choose a specific dynamic system to work on.

We had several idea of simulations, like predator/prey systems, or road simulations, ...
We, as a group of four students, finally chose the simulation of a restaurant which is a type of model called ABM, or Agent Based Model.
ABM is a pretty new concept initiated in 1971, made possible by new mathematical theories and new computer capabilities.
The idea behind an agent based model, is to set rules at an individual level on each entity called autonomous agents, and then to analyze how their interactions result in system wide changes.

An ABM is defined on wikipedia as 

“ a class of computational models for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents with a view to assessing their effects on the system as a whole”

This technique enables the possibility to analyze complex systems which we could not analyze before.
There are a lot of relatively significant work that have been done thanks to this technique! 
It has been used in biology with the analysis of the evolution of epidemics, or in business with the modelisation of logistics, in economics and social sciences, …

Specifically our ABM is about analyzing how the waiting time of the clients evolves in a restaurant according to different parameters. 

## Our Model and the parameters

The configuration of the restaurant:

- The number of tables of four people (which is a limitation of our model)
- The Menu with several choices and variable cooking time

The employees:

- The waiters
- The kitchen

The result we are analazing:

- The average client's waiting time

## The main goal:

Our plan according to this model, is to determine and compare the average client waiting time. 

In fact according to the configuration of a restaurant and a given variable 


## How it could be usefull

In fact, we can determine, the optimal workforce (Waiters/Cooks) needed for a specific restaurant configuration.
As a conclusion, our system could be used to streamline and optimize the workforce needed for each specific restaurant configuration and average client affluence. This could save money, improve the client satisfaction, and facilitate the restaurants management
